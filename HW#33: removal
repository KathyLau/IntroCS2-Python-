"""
POP:
syntax: list.pop([i])
behavior: removes and returns the item at the given position in the list.
REMOVE: 
syntax: list.remove(i)
behavior: removes the first item from the list whose value is x. It is an error if there is no such item.
DEL:
syntax: del L [i]
behavior: There is a way to remove an item from a list given its index instead of its value:
the del statement. This differs from the pop() method which returns a value.
The del statement can also be used to remove slices from a list or clear the entire list


HotTea prefers del L [i] for use in rmNegatives() because the function turned out to be short and clean.
